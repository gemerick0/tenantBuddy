        "The hearing officer ruled in favor of the tenant, awarding them a rent reduction due to unlawful rent increases, and a rent reduction due to the landlord\u2019s failure to make necessary repairs and maintain a habitable premises. The hearing officer ordered the landlord to repay the tenant $7,015.18 for unlawful rent, and $5,850.00 in rent reduction due to failure to maintain a habitable premises and reduction in housing services. Additionally, the hearing officer ordered the landlord to replace the bathtub, shower, and sinks in the bathroom within 30 days of this order becoming final.  The hearing officer also ordered the landlord to reimburse the tenant $400.00 for a plumbing invoice which the tenant was improperly charged for and which the hearing officer ruled was the responsibility of the landlord.",
        "The Hearing Officer awarded a rent rebate of $1,100.00 for the hot water issues from 12/1/2022 to 4/30/2023, and a daily rent rebate of $7.33/day beginning 5/1/2023 until the issues are resolved.",
        "The court ruled in favor of the tenant. The tenant was awarded $3,000 in damages for the mold and $1,000 in damages for the landlord shutting off the utilities. The court also ordered the landlord to pay the tenant\u2019s legal fees. The total compensation was $4,000. The tenant was deemed to have a significant problem with mold, and they were entitled to a large amount of compensation.  ",
        "Petitioner was entitled to a ten percent (10%) downward adjustment of rent due and a rent refund. Petitioner\u2019s Rent is $2,200.00 per month, and assessing the ten percent (10%) reduction, Petitioner is entitled to a rent credit of $7.33 per day or $220.00 per month since December 1, 2022, for each day the minimum water temperature requirement is not met. As of April 30, 2023, the aggregate figure is $1,100.00.",
        "The hearing officer decided that the tenant was owed $400 for the mold in the bathroom, $400 for the mold in the living room, $80 for the broken wiring, $80 for the heater being broken, $80 for the lights being broken, and $80 for the lock being broken. The landlord was ordered to pay $2,800 in total for the repairs.",
        "The hearing officer found that the landlord had committed several violations of the CSFRA.  The officer ruled that the 2021 rent increase was unlawful and ordered the landlord to pay the tenant $1,500 for the difference between the rent paid and the unlawful rent demanded.  The officer also found that the landlord had failed to maintain the rental unit in a habitable condition.  The officer ordered the landlord to make the necessary repairs to the unit and ordered the landlord to pay the tenant $6,717 in damages for the failure to maintain the unit in a habitable condition. The officer also ordered the landlord to pay the total amount owed to the tenant, $8,217.06, through rent credits, over a period of 11 months.",
        "The Hearing Officer determined that the landlord had not substantially complied with the CSFRA and was not entitled to increase rent. The tenant was entitled to a refund of the excess rent paid since May 1, 2022. The landlord was ordered to pay $2,317.66 in rent overpayments.",
        "The Petitioner is entitled to a twenty-five percent (25%) total reduction of the monthly maximum lawful rent for the Property for that period. The reduction reflects an awarded reduction of twenty percent (20%) for the presence of mold in the garage and the likely presence in the living room and a five percent (5%) reduction for the intrusion of water into the living room. The Petitioner is entitled to a rent refund of $1,293.00 for the excess Rent he paid to Respondent between December 12, 2022, through January 31, 2023.",
        "The Hearing Officer decided that the respondent incorrectly calculated the Base Rent for the initial term of the tenant\u2019s lease and that the rent increases on June 1, 2022 and September 1, 2022 were unlawful. The Hearing Officer ordered the respondent to refund the tenant $1,349.08, and ordered the tenant to pay a balance due to the respondent of $542.19.  The Hearing Officer also ordered the respondent to apply the $806.89 owed to the tenant as a credit against the tenant\u2019s rent for January 2023.",
        "The Hearing Officer found that Respondent had unlawfully demanded and retained rent in excess of the amount permitted by the CSFRA because Respondent did not properly roll back the rent for the Affected Unit to its level on October 19, 2015, as required by CSFRA Sections 1702(b)(1) and 1706(a), and did not properly refund Petitioner the amount of the unlawful rent collected due to the improper rent rollback. The Hearing Officer further concluded that the rent increase imposed by Respondent effective September 1, 2018 was unlawful pursuant to CSFRA Sections 1706(a) and (b) and 1707(a) because it did not use the correct Base Rent and that all subsequent rent increases were unlawful. Respondent was required to refund Petitioner $8,357.18 in unlawfully collected rent for December 23, 2016 through December 31, 2023. The Hearing Officer also concluded that Respondent acted in contravention of CSFRA Section 1710(b)(1), California Health and Safety Code Section 17920.3(c), and Mountain View Municipal Code, Ch. 21, Art. II, Section 21.56 by allowing tenants of the Property to smoke in their rental units with resultant secondhand smoke drifting into the Petitioner\u2019s unit and affecting Petitioner\u2019s health, welfare and safety, entitling Petitioner to a total rent refund of $8,039.90 for the period between March 15, 2019 and the date of the HO Decision. The Hearing Officer also found that the Respondent failed to maintain the Property in a habitable condition by allowing a rodent infestation to continue for over two years and was liable for a total refund of $155.37. The Hearing Officer further concluded that Respondent violated CSFRA Section 1710(b)(1), California Health and Safety Code Section 17920.3(a)(10), and International Property Maintenance Code Section 402.3 by failing to remediate inadequate lighting in the parking lot for over 17 months and was liable to Petitioner for a total refund of $1,052.25. The Hearing Officer also found that Respondent failed to maintain the Property in a habitable condition by not promptly installing a new door lock and dead bolt after an attempted break-in at Petitioner\u2019s unit and was liable for a total refund of $295.00. The Hearing Officer concluded that Respondent failed to maintain the Property in habitable condition by permitting an inordinate amount of bulky trash to remain on the Property over a period of almost four years and was liable for a total refund of $2,179.51. The Hearing Officer also found that there was a reduction in housing services due to Respondent\u2019s failure to keep the swimming pool clean and sanitary for several months each year over the course of four years and that the Respondent was liable for a total refund of $1,872.00 for the closures in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Hearing Officer further concluded that Respondent improperly reduced housing services by closing the laundry rooms on the premises for four months due to vandalism and vagrancy and that the Respondent was liable for a total refund of $441.92 for the period from June 3, 2022 through September 28, 2022. The Hearing Officer also found that Respondent\u2019s failure to remedy the nuisance behaviors and threatening behaviors of other tenants on the Property constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in Petitioner\u2019s Lease, which, being a benefit connected with the use or occupancy of the Affected Unit, constitutes a decrease in Housing Services pursuant to CSFRA Sections 1702(h) and 1710(c). As a result, Petitioner was entitled to a 20 percent reduction of the monthly rent for the 36-month period from December 20, 2020 through December 20, 2023, or a total refund of $11,016.00. The Hearing Officer concluded that the Respondent improperly decreased Housing Services by failing to have an on-site property manager from February 1, 2020 through February 28, 2022, and that Respondent was liable for a total refund of $1,522.10.",
        "The Hearing Officer finds in favor of Petitioner and orders Respondent to refund to Petitioner $8,357.18 in unlawfully collected rent and $26,574.05 in damages due to habitability issues and decreased housing services. The Hearing Officer finds that Respondent is prohibited from issuing rent increases for Petitioner\u2019s apartment until all of the refunds are paid in full, and Respondent has complied with all of the provisions of the CSFRA.",
        "The hearing officer decided that the landlord is not entitled to increase the rent because they have not registered the property with the Rent Stabilization Program. The hearing officer ruled that the landlord is not entitled to the increase of rent and that the tenant is entitled to the rent they have overpaid which totals $3,040.42. The hearing officer also made the landlord pay the additional amount overpaid for February 2023\u2019s rent and utilities.",
        "The hearing officer found that the tenant's income was significantly below 120% of the median household income for Santa Clara County. The hearing officer also found that the landlord's noncompliance with registration requirements constituted substantial noncompliance with the CSFRA, precluding the landlord from instituting any rent increase, including banked increases, prior to October 10, 2022. The hearing officer awarded the tenant a rebate of the entire amount of the rent increase she paid from September 1 through October 9, 2022, and a reduction in her monthly rent obligation equivalent to the banked increases continuing thereafter until August 31, 2023.",

        "The Hearing Officer found that the minimum water temperature standard for residential properties is \u201cnot less than 110 degrees Fahrenheit\u201d and that the Respondent\u2019s failure to provide that temperature constituted a failure to maintain a habitable premises. Petitioner was entitled to an eight percent (8%) downward adjustment of rent and a rent refund of $2,640.00 for the 16-month period from December 2022 through March 2024.",
        "The hearing officer ruled in favor of the tenants and ordered a rent rollback, totaling $7,321.44, for the period from September 26, 2022, to the date of the decision.

The Tenant was awarded a rebate of the entire rent increase paid from September 1 through October 9.",
        "The Hearing Officer determined that the Petitioner\u2019s income was below 100% of the AMI, and therefore, they qualified for relief from the banked increase. The Hearing Officer also found that the rent increase from $1,416.25 to $1,444.50 was not properly noticed and therefore invalid. The Hearing Officer ordered the Respondent to refund any overpayments made by the Petitioner and to implement a 5% rent increase, resulting in a new rent of $1,487.06.",

The Hearing Officer also found that the landlord had unlawfully collected a pet deposit, and that pet rent should be considered as part of the base rent. Finally, the Hearing Officer found that the rent increases in 2022 and 2023 were unlawful and ordered the landlord to refund the tenants the total amount of $6,072.11 for the overpayment of rent and $500 for the pet deposit.",
